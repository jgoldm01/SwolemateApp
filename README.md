 SwoleMate
============

2. Problem statement: How do you stay motivated while working out? how are you 
held accountable to sticking to a workout plan? maybe your firends aren't at 
the same level of fitness or dont have the same goals as you. swoleMate will 
help you find someone with similar goals and capabilities (if thats what youre 
into) who you can be gym buddies/motivators/coaches/SWOLEMATES

3. How do we solve the problem?
* web application

4. list features we'll implement:
* pretty interface
* give user list of potential gym buddies based on our profile criterion 
  match algorithm (see data we'll be using and collecting for the specific
  criterion)
* messaging service; ability to contact other users who both match
* ability to confirm when a goal has been met

Pick 5:
	* Geolocation
	* server side data persistence. 
	* front end framework 
	* send emails and sms
	* reporting with charts and graphs


5. data we'll be using and collecting
* keep track of users' profiles, descriptions, data, friends
* history of commitments / goals met
* whether the user is looking for cardio, weightlifting, or both
* user's name and age


6. algorithms


7. electronic mockups
