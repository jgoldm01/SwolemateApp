TEAM 8
Progress Report Nov 14th

WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED DURING THE WEEK
1) Began the html for the dashboard page (with Bootstrap)
2) Go login page working (with Passport); persistence with session storage
3) Linked passport with MongoDB system
4) Worked on backend stuff (server.js, routes.js, views, etc)
Note: our heroku is "swolemate"

CHALLENGES AND ISSES FACED
1) Tried to use express, but there was a new version which kept breaking,
took a lot of debugging to get it to work
2) Rethinking and redesigning our dashboard. Decided to combine settings
page, swolelationship page, and goal history page with the dashboard. Now we
only have 3 pages
3) Not sure how to get the dashboard to fit into the AngularJS framework
 
GOALS FOR NEXT WEEK
1) Build the actual API based on our Apiary mock api
2) Finish dashboard html and css
3) Be able to create a user object and send that data to MongoDB
4) Be able to set swolemate matching preferences
