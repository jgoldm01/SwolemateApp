#TEAM 8
##Nov 21st Progress Report

###What was accomplished during the week?
1. Dashboard html, have buttons, fixed navigation bar
2. Built mongoose schema for account, swolelationship, goal and message
3. Able to set up RESTful path names for swolelationship functions with regex

###Challenges and Issues Faced
1. For the dashboard html, it was difficult to create a chat/message box.
Looked for bootstrap examples, but did not find any that fit our needs
2. Learning how to use regular expressions
3. Learning mongoose
4. Made big design decisions, will only have 3 pages: create account/login,
dashboard (contains settings, swolelationship, about me, goal history), and
find a swolemate

####Goals for Next Week
1. Convert dashboard static html to React template (instead of AngularJS)
2. Finish implementing RESTful api calls
3. Start static html for find a swolemate page

1. Very good that you are scoping down the project.  That's not a bad thing at all.  Focus on functionality.  Don't focus on security (e.g., password encryption) because this is a _prototype_.
2. "Tried to use express, but there was a new version which kept breaking, " --sigh, I feel your pain.  It is what it is.
3. Have you checked out a regex cheat sheet? See http://regexlib.com/CheatSheet.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1.  Also http://rubular.com/ is a great tool to test regular expressions.
4. Why React?
