TEAM 8
Progress Report for Nov 7th

What was accomplished during the week 

1. Finished flow chart of how each page is linked to other pages
   (Content_Flow.png)
2. Finished a list of expected API actions
   (APIactions.txt)
3. Designed a mock API on Apiary
   (apiary.apib)
4. Designed user object (example_user.json), swolelationship object(example_
   swolelationship.json), goal object (example_goal.json)
5. Set up Node.js backend (express, passport)
6. Set up swolemate heroku 
7. Mockup of what the Dashboard should look like in final product


Challenges and issues team faced during the week

1. We made the decision to switch to only having one Swolemate instead of 
   being able to have multiple. There would only be one swolelationship page,
   instead of multiple. Realized having multiple swolelationship pages was
   too difficult
2. We were unsure what frameworks to use for login. Decided on Passport
3. We were unsure how to make every page fit together. Designed the API on 
   apiary so that we could get a better idea of what information we could 
   expect to send and receive
4. We had trouble agreeing on the overall flow of the page (content-flow) and
   what the dashboard would look like

Goals for next week
1. Get login page working with Passport
2. Build the actual API
3. Be able to create a User object and send that information to data store,
   probably MongoDB
4. Learn how to use AngularJS as our frontend framework
5. Get Dashboard html started

Comments by Ming
* What's the Heroku URL?
* Why Angular? Nothing wrong with the choice but what's the rationale?
* Cool that you're going with Passport.  Let me know how that goes.
